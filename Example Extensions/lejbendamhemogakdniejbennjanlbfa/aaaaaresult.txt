FALSE POSITIVE: local DOM injection triggered?

The Subtle Taint Flow Arcanum Would Detect
The flag is not about data being stolen, but about the principle of how data flows within the page. Here is the step-by-step process Arcanum would follow:

The Source: Reading from the DOM

The researchers' test setup would have a replayed Facebook page where sensitive elements are marked, or the tool would consider the entire page content as a potential source.

The script reads the text of elements on the page using textNode.nodeValue.

According to the Arcanum paper, reading content from DOM elements (

nodeValue, innerText, etc.) is a defined taint source. At this moment, the text string (e.g., "Like") becomes tainted.


The Propagation: Control Flow Dependency

The tainted string is then used inside a conditional statement: if (textNode.nodeValue==human[j]).

The Arcanum taint tracking engine is specifically designed to handle this. The paper states that if a tainted value is used in a conditional expression, any operations inside that conditional block are also considered tainted.

This means the execution of the code inside the if block is now dependent on sensitive (tainted) data.

The "Sink": Writing Back to the DOM

Because the if statement was true, the code executes the line: textNode.nodeValue = dict.serval;.

This is a write operation to the DOM. Because this action is dependent on the tainted data from the step above, the write itself is considered a tainted operation.

While this is not an exfiltration sink like a network request, Arcanum's engine is sensitive enough to log this as a completed data flow: data was read from the DOM, and that data influenced a subsequent write to the DOM.

Conclusion: A Technical Finding, Not a Malicious One
In this scenario, Arcanum is functioning exactly as designed by its creators. It has detected a complete data flow from a source to a sink. However, this specific flow does not represent a real-world privacy risk to the user.

Is there malicious intent? No. The extension is doing exactly what it promises in a harmless way.

Is data being stolen? No. The data never leaves the webpage.

Is this a false positive? Yes, in the sense that it is not a meaningful security threat. It is a true positive only from a purely technical, data-flow-tracking perspective. The tool has correctly flagged that information read from one part of the page influenced a change in another part of the page, which is the limit of what it was asked to do.

It is very likely the researchers sent you this file as an example of the sensitivity of their toolâ€”showing that it can detect even these subtle, intra-page data flows that do not involve any data exfiltration.
