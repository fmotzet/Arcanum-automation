FALSE POSITIVE: not malicous, code get sent to users configured server

Why Arcanum Would Flag This Extension:
The extension's core function creates a classic taint flow that would be detected:

Taint Source: The details.url from the onBeforeNavigate listener. This is the user's browsing history.

Taint Sink: The fetch call inside the hx_lookup function, which sends the hostname from the URL over the network.
Arcanum would flag this because it detects that sensitive user data (the websites they visit) is being collected and transmitted over the network.
